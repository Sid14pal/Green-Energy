        "Cow Premium Bilona Ghee is a traditionally prepared ghee made using the Bilona method, an ancient Vedic process. Fresh curd made from cow’s milk is churned bi-directionally to extract makkhan (butter), which is then slow-cooked to produce pure golden ghee. This method preserves natural nutrients, aroma, and granular texture, ensuring a rich and authentic taste.",
